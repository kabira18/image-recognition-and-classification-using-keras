Image Recognition and Classification using Keras and EBImage in R


Overview


This repository contains R code for building and training a deep learning model using Keras and EBImage to classify images into two categories: planes and cars. We utilize a dataset of 6 images (3 planes and 3 cars) to demonstrate image recognition and classification.


Repository Contents


- image_classification.R: R script containing code for data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.
- images: Folder containing 12 images (6 planes and 6 cars) used for training and testing.



Requirements



- Following R packages:
    - keras
    - tensorflow (backend for Keras)
    - EBImage
    - dplyr
    - ggplot2
